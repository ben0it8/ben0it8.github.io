[![poetry generator](https://github.com/ben0it8/poetry-language-model/blob/master/pics/versgen.gif?raw=true)](http://oddnumberofeyes.com/versgenerator/)

The idea was to release a webapp where everyone can generate their _own_ verses in the style of a number of great Hungarian poets. This was achieved by training state-of-the-art neural language models on each author's complete life work, resulting in some intruiging lines. 
If you are interested in training your own language models, check out the [project repository](https://github.com/ben0it8/poetry-language-model).
